# Title: 
Happy/Sad Mood Image Classifier
## Description: 
This project creates a computer program that can look at pictures of faces and tell if the person is happy or sad. It uses a special kind of artificial intelligence called a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn from a collection of happy and sad face pictures.

## Responsibilities:
* Preparing the face pictures for the computer to understand.
* Building the "brain" (CNN) that learns to recognize happy and sad faces.
* Teaching the "brain" to recognize happy and sad faces.
* Testing how well the "brain" can guess the mood of new faces.
* Using the trained program to guess the mood of new face images.
