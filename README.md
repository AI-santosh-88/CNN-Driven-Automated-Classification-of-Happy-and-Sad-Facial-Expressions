# Title: 
Happy/Sad Mood Image Classifier

## Description: 
This project creates a computer program that can look at pictures of faces and tell if the person is happy or sad. It uses a special kind of artificial intelligence called a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn from a collection of happy and sad face pictures.

## Responsibilities:
* Preparing the face pictures for the computer to understand.
* Building the "brain" (CNN) that learns to recognize happy and sad faces.
* Teaching the "brain" to recognize happy and sad faces.
* Testing how well the "brain" can guess the mood of new faces.
* Using the trained program to guess the mood of new face images.

## Libraries:
1. TensorFlow/Keras: Tools for building and training the "brain."
2. NumPy: Tools for working with lists of numbers (image data).
3. OpenCV: Tools for working with pictures.
4. Matplotlib: Tools for showing pictures.
5. ImageDataGenerator: tools for modifying the training images, to help the model learn better.

## Summary:
* It builds a computer program that can identify happy or sad moods from facial images.
* It uses a type of artificial intelligence (CNN) to learn from example pictures.
* The program is designed to accurately determine the mood of a person in a picture.
* This is a project that uses AI to understand human emotions from pictures.
